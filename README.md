Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently studying Systems Engineering, and I'm passionate about software development.

My main focus is on C++ and Java as I continue to expand my knowledge across different languages.


What you'll find here:
C++ Projects:

Examples of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, algorithms, problem-solving tasks+, etc.

Java Projects: 

Applications implementing design patterns like MVC, with an emphasis on data handling and user interface integration.
I'm always eager to learn and improve, and I hope these projects reflect my journey as a developer and my growth throughout my degree.
Feel free to check them out!
